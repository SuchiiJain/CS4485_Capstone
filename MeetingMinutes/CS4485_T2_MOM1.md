## Discussion Summary

### 1. Role Assignments

| Role | Members |
|---|---|
| **Frontend Developer** | Marie Liske, Anusua Halder |
| **Backend Developer** | Marie Liske, Samuel Say, Aaron Santhosh, Portia Hamid, Suchi Jain |
| **ML Engineer** | Aaron Santhosh, Portia Hamid, Suchi Jain |
| **QA Tester** | Anusua Halder, Samuel Say, Portia Hamid |

### 2. Key Decisions

- **Tech Stack Confirmed:** Python for CLI scanner, FastAPI for backend API
- **Primary Language for MVP:** Python will be the focus language for initial development
- **Testing Strategy:** QA team will create test repositories with intentional documentation mismatches during Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2)
- **Repository Structure:** Frontend and backend will be maintained in separate GitHub repositories to keep codebases organized
- **Documentation Location:** Project proposal document will be stored in GitHub and kept up-to-date for TA review

### 3. Questions/Concerns Raised

- Figure out what AI tools we'll be using during development (Cursor, Copilot, Claude, etc.)
- Make sure that if/when we start working on the frontend, we create a separate GitHub repo instead of combining it with the backend
- Make sure the TA has access to the GitHub repository
- Add the project document to GitHub and keep it up-to-date so we don't need to re-submit it every week
