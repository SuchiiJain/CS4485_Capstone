# Week 2 — February 16-20, 2026

**Team Leader for Week 2: Marie Liske**

**Total Hours Spent: 8**

---

### Marie Liske
- **Hours:** 2
- **Tasks Complete:**
  - Set up Jira board and organized Sprint 2 tasks
  - Set up Figma workspace for UI planning
  - Led hash function design discussion and defined hashing approach for mismatch detection
  - Contributed to API contract design (Scans, Reports, Mismatches, Config, Hashes objects)
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - Define and document the hash function specification precisely (ensure cosmetic changes do not affect hash output)
  - Finalize API contract documentation and push to GitHub
  - Begin Figma wireframes once development start is confirmed
  - Confirm documentation-currency detection approach (timestamp-based vs. reverse detection)
- **Issues:**
  - Hash function definition requires careful scoping — if too broad, cosmetic changes may incorrectly trigger documentation flags
  - Wireframing is blocked until Phase 1 development officially begins

---

### Anusua Halder
- **Hours:** 1
- **Tasks Complete:**
  - Prepared and documented Minutes of Meeting (MOM #1 and MOM #2)
  - Created MeetingMinutes folder on GitHub and uploaded all MOM documents
  - Maintained weekly progress documentation
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - Update Weekly Status Report after each meeting
  - Add Week 3 MOM once February 27 meeting is complete
  - Review `pseudocode.py` and provide feedback or suggestions
- **Issues:** N/A

---

### Suchi Jain
- **Hours:** 1
- **Tasks Complete:**
  - Set up the GitHub repository (CS4485_Capstone)
  - Granted TA access to the repository
  - Pushed project proposal and supporting documents to GitHub for TA review
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - Begin Phase 1 development: CLI scanner skeleton in Python
  - Review and provide feedback on `pseudocode.py`
  - Confirm documentation-currency detection approach with the team
- **Issues:**
  - CLI scanner development cannot fully begin until hash function specification is finalized

---

### Aaron Santhosh
- **Hours:** 1
- **Tasks Complete:**
  - Attended and participated in weekly team meeting (February 20, 2026)
  - Contributed to API contract discussion during the MOM meeting
  - Reviewed project proposal and Sprint 2 task breakdown on Jira
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - Review `pseudocode.py` and provide feedback on ML/algorithm logic
  - Research AST parsing approach for code change detection
  - Assist with Phase 1 CLI scanner development
- **Issues:**
  - Needs to confirm specific Phase 1 task assignments before development begins

---

### Samuel Say
- **Hours:** 1
- **Tasks Complete:**
  - Researched and finalized AI development tools for the team (GitHub Copilot, VS Code, Cursor)
  - Documented tool selection decisions for team reference
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - Review `pseudocode.py` and provide feedback or suggestions
  - Support QA test repository setup for Phase 1 (intentional documentation mismatches)
- **Issues:**
  - QA test repository setup depends on CLI scanner skeleton being in place first

---

### Portia Hamid
- **Hours:** 2
- **Tasks Complete:**
  - Led pseudocode development for the weight-based mismatch detection algorithm
  - Pushed `brainstorming.txt` and `pseudocode.py` to GitHub
  - Used Claude 4.6 to validate pseudocode logic and identify gaps in the detection approach
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - Refine `pseudocode.py` based on team feedback
  - Assist with defining the hash function specification
  - Begin translating pseudocode into working Python code for Phase 1
- **Issues:**
  - Weight thresholds for mismatch scoring are not yet finalized — team needs to agree on what score triggers a documentation flag
