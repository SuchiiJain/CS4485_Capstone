## Discussion Summary

### 1. Action Item Follow-Ups from MOM #1

- GitHub repositories have been set up (frontend and backend kept separate). TA has been granted access.
- Figma workspace has been created: [CS4485 Project Figma](https://www.figma.com/buzz/mL6QjBH9IeETv4zAOJ3g94/CS4485-Project)
- Project proposal document has been added to GitHub and will be kept up-to-date for TA review.
- A master resource post was pinned in the team channel containing links to all project resources:
  - [Project Proposal/Outline Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZbjSpHaQeb9Rg--xcP3GUAERLZ7kBgBILVkYgC4FTvo/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SuchiiJain/CS4485_Capstone)
  - [Jira Board](https://cs4485-team2.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CS4485/boards/1)
  - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/buzz/mL6QjBH9IeETv4zAOJ3g94/CS4485-Project)
  - [Proposal Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1355p0d5Op-54dubH1q7afbhFPoNqRuY2SPyVKgk4vvE/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Weekly Meeting Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/111IzuTn2pWiBYfZ1uFq7XUuv8RakiqX3jziEAbVMmnI/edit?usp=sharing)
- Wireframing has not yet begun as development has not started — will be revisited once Phase 1 commences.

### 2. AI Tool Selection Finalized

- **Primary tools confirmed:** GitHub Copilot and VS Code
- Cursor may also be used by team members with prior experience
- Professor encouraged broader AI tool usage (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) for code generation, pseudocode review, spec validation, and cross-verification between agents
- Note: Claude 4.6 was used to generate the initial pseudocode in `pseudocode.py` given the project specs, and to identify any gaps in logic

### 3. Technical Design: Weight-Based Mismatch Detection

Code changes will be assigned weights based on significance:

| Change Type | Weight |
|---|---|
| Whitespace / comments | +0 |
| Constant changes | +1 |
| Loop changes | +3 |
| Exception behavior changes | +8 |

- Once the cumulative score surpasses a defined threshold, related documentation will be flagged as likely needing an update
- Minor refactoring carries no weight and will not trigger flags
- Pseudocode implementing this logic has been pushed to GitHub (`brainstorming.txt` and `pseudocode.py`)
- Professor emphasized the hash function must be precisely defined so purely cosmetic code changes do not affect hash output or trigger false documentation flags

### 4. Technical Design: API Contracts

| Object | Description | Key Endpoints |
|---|---|---|
| **Scans** | Contains `scan_id`, repo path, commit hash, status | `GET /scans`, `GET /scans/{id}`, `PUT /scans/{id}`, `DELETE /scans/{id}` |
| **Reports** | Linked to `scan_id`; includes rot score, mismatch count, code index | `GET /scans/{id}/report` |
| **Mismatches** | Nested in reports; identifies mismatch type (deleted, moved, etc.) | `GET /scans/{id}/mismatches`, `GET /scans/{id}/mismatches/{mismatch_id}` |
| **Config** | Allows updating detection config without modifying code | `GET /config`, `PUT /config` |
| **Hashes** | Backend use; properly defined to handle cosmetic changes | `GET /hashes`, `POST /hashes` |

### 5. Documentation Currency & Reverse-Approach Discussion

- Professor raised the question of how the system determines whether recently changed documentation actually reflects corresponding code changes
- Team discussed potential approaches: timestamp-based comparison and a reverse-detection approach
- This remains an open design question; the final product should be complete and extensible for future upgrades

### 6. Language & Documentation Format Confirmed

- **Primary language for MVP:** Python (finalized)
- **Documentation format:** Markdown
- The system will perform code matching between each push to determine whether code has changed sufficiently to warrant a documentation flag
