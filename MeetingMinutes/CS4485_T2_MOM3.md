## Agenda

1. Review Phase 1 development progress and action items from MOM #2
2. Finalize hash function specification
3. Review and approve API contract documentation

## Discussion Summary

### 1. Phase 1 Development Progress Review

The team reviewed all completed work from the week. Significant progress was made across all core modules:

- Finalized `pseudocode.py` incorporating team feedback, authored `Architecture.md` mapping the full 4-layer pipeline, and implemented `ast_parser.py` and `fingerprint.py` — the core AST parsing and semantic fingerprint extraction modules. Example scripts (`example_basic_ast.py`, `example_fingerprinting.py`) were also created to validate module correctness.
- Implemented `run.py`, the main pipeline entry point that ties all existing modules together. Integrated the `flagging_threshold.py` severity model with the comparator/alerts pipeline and connected `report_generation.py` to produce both `.docrot-report.txt` and `.docrot-report.json` output files on each scan.
- Implemented config-driven documentation mapping, strengthened threshold handling with validation and safe defaults, and improved persistence reliability using atomic baseline writes.
- Wrote `flagging_threshold.py` — defining all core data structures (`Flag`, `CodeElement`, `DocReference`), severity enums, `SEVERITY_MAP`, and all `check_*` detection functions including the main `run_flagging()` pipeline. Wrote `report_generation.py` — implementing the `ScanReport` class and both `.txt` and `.json` report generators. Both files were pushed to `src/` on GitHub with full inline comments. README was updated to reflect both new modules.
- Created the PostgreSQL database schema on a local machine and pushed the SQL file to the main branch. Also reviewed `pseudocode.py` and provided feedback.

### 2. Hash Function Specification

- The team confirmed the hash function must only reflect semantically meaningful changes to code — cosmetic changes such as whitespace, formatting, and comment edits must not affect the hash output
- The approach uses AST-level fingerprinting rather than raw text hashing, ensuring that only structural and behavioral changes trigger documentation flags
- This is implemented in `fingerprint.py` which extracts 7 feature dimensions per function: signature, control flow, conditions, calls, side effects, exceptions, and returns

### 3. API Contract Review

- The API contract documentation has been finalized and pushed to `API_Contract.md` in the GitHub repository
- The team reviewed all five API objects: Scans, Reports, Mismatches, Config, and Hashes
- Endpoints are well defined and consistent with the project proposal
- The Config object allows threshold and weight updates without modifying code directly, which was highlighted as important for extensibility

### 4. Wireframe Review

- Figma wireframes have not yet been started as Phase 1 development was the priority this week
- Wireframing will begin in Phase 2 once the core scanner is stable
